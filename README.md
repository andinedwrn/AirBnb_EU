The objective of this case is to develop a machine learning model using random forest classification to predict whether an Airbnb listing is a superhost based on various features. This includes understanding the concept of Supervised Learning, preparing the data for Supervised Learning models, implementing Supervised Learning techniques using the provided data, and performing Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Improvement to enhance the model's performance.  This project showcases the proficiency in applying supervised learning techniques and demonstrates the value of collective knowledge and collaborative problem-solving. The dataset was effectively prepared and preprocessed, and multiple classification algorithms including Decision Tree and Random Forest, were implemented. Cross-validation and evaluation metrics were employed to assess the models' performance, with the Random Forest model demonstrating the highest accuracy of 88%. The model was further improved through hyperparameter tuning, resulting in enhanced predictive capabilities. Overall, this project has demonstrated the successful application of Supervised Learning techniques and data analysis methodologies to develop an effective Classification model for predicting Airbnb's superhost predicate.
